# 4-Bit-ALU-Implementation-on-FPGA
Designed and implemented a 4-bit combinational ALU in Verilog HDL supporting arithmetic and logical operations, and deployed it on a Spartan-7 FPGA using Vivado.  Performed timing and power analysis using virtual clock constraints, achieving positive slack with low on-chip power consumption.
